amCharts 5 Dashboard Analysis
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of amCharts 5 to create a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing student data from Zewail City University. The dashboard provides valuable insights into the student population across various metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making for the university administration.
Key Features

Gender Distribution: A pie chart showcasing the percentage breakdown of male and female students.
Student Enrollment by Faculty: A funnel chart visualizing the distribution of students across different academic faculties.
Student Distribution by Major: A bar chart displaying the number of students in each academic major.
Grade Distribution by Major: A bullet graph comparing the grade (A, B, C) distributions within each major.

Dashboard Layout Rationale
The dashboard layout is designed to provide a logical and intuitive flow of information:

Gender Distribution: Prominently placed at the top to highlight this key demographic metric.
Student Enrollment by Faculty: Positioned below the gender chart to emphasize the breakdown of students across academic divisions.
Student Distribution by Major: Located at the bottom to showcase the detailed distribution of students by academic major.
Grade Distribution by Major: Placed alongside the major distribution to enable comparative analysis of grade performance.

The color choices use contrasting hues to differentiate between data categories, improving visual appeal and clarity. The grouping of related information, such as gender and faculty, aligns with how users may mentally organize the data, facilitating easier comprehension.
